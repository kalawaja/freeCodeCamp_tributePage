# Tribute Page

> `Certification Project`
> ## Tribute Page
> - This is one of the required projects to earn your certification.
> - For this project, you will build a tribute page for a subject of your choosing, fictional or real.

> ### **Instructions**
> **Build a Tribute Page** <br>
> <br>
> **Objective:** Build an app that is functionally similar to [Tribute Page](https://tribute-page.freecodecamp.rocks) <br>
> <br>
> **User Stories:**
> 1. Your tribute page should have a `main` element with a corresponding `id` of `main`, which contains all other elements
> 2. You should see an element with an `id` of `title`, which contains a string (i.e. text), that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug")
> 3. You should see either a `figure` or a `div` element with an `id` of `img-div`
> 4.  Within the `#img-div` element, you should see an `img` element with a corresponding `id="image"`
> 5. Within the `#img-div` element, you should see an element with a corresponding `id="img-caption"` that contains textual content describing the image shown in `#img-div`
> 6. You should see an element with a corresponding `id="tribute-info"`, which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page
> 7. You should see an `a` element with a corresponding `id="tribute-link"`, which links to an outside site, that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of `target` and set it to `_blank` in order for your link to open in a new tab
> 8. Your `#image` should use `max-width` and `height` properties to resize responsively, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size
> 9. Your `img` element should be centered within its parent element <br>

> Fulfill the user stories and pass all the tests below to complete this project. Give it your own personal style. Happy Coding! <br>

> **Note:** Be sure to add ```<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">``` in your HTML to link your stylesheet and apply your CSS <br>

> ## **Solutions** <br>
> **Follow Step by Step** <br><br>

> **Step 1** <br>
Your tribute page should have a `main` element with a corresponding `id` of `main`, which contains all other elements

```html
#index.html
    <main id="main">

    </main>
```
```css
#styles.css
html {
  /* Setting a base font size of 10px give us easier rem calculations
       Info: 1rem === 10px, 1.5rem === 15px, 2rem === 20px and so forth
     */
  font-size: 10px;
}
```
> **Step 2** <br>
You should see an element with an `id` of `title`, which contains a string (i.e. text), that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug")

```html
#index.html
    <main id="main">
      <h1 id="title">Dr. Norman Borlaug</h1>
      <p>The man who saved a billion lives</p>

    </main>
```
```css
#styles.css
body {
  /* Native font stack https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.2/content/reboot/#native-font-stack */
  font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', 'Roboto',
    'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;
  font-size: 1.6rem;
  line-height: 1.5;
  text-align: center;
  color: #333;
  margin: 0;
}

h1 {
  font-size: 4rem;
  margin-bottom: 0;
}

@media (max-width: 460px) {
  h1 {
    font-size: 3.5rem;
    line-height: 1.2;
  }
}

h2 {
  font-size: 3.25rem;
}
```
> **Step 3** <br>
You should see either a `figure` or a `div` element with an `id` of `img-div`

```html
#index.html
    <main id="main">
      <h1 id="title">Dr. Norman Borlaug</h1>
      <p>The man who saved a billion lives</p>
      <figure id="img-div">
        
      <figure>
    </main>
```
> **Step 4** <br>
Within the `#img-div` element, you should see an `img` element with a corresponding `id="image"`

```html
#index.html
    <main id="main">
      <h1 id="title">Dr. Norman Borlaug</h1>
      <p>The man who saved a billion lives</p>
      <figure id="img-div">
        <img id="image" src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/images/tribute-page-main-image.jpg" alt="Dr. Norman Borlaug seen standing in Mexican wheat field with a group of biologists">
      <figure>
    </main>
```
> **Step 5** <br>
Within the `#img-div` element, you should see an element with a corresponding `id="img-caption"` that contains textual content describing the image shown in `#img-div`

```html
#index.html
    <main id="main">
      <h1 id="title">Dr. Norman Borlaug</h1>
      <p>The man who saved a billion lives</p>
      <figure id="img-div">
        <img
          id="image"
          src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/images/tribute-page-main-image.jpg"
          alt="Dr. Norman Borlaug seen standing in Mexican wheat field with a group of biologists"
        />
        <figcaption id="img-caption">
          Dr. Norman Borlaug, third from the left, trains biologists in Mexico
          on how to increase wheat yields - part of his life-long war on hunger.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
    </main>
```
> **Step 6** <br>
You should see an element with a corresponding `id="tribute-info"`, which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page

```html
#index.html
      <section id="tribute-info">
        <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1914</strong> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1933</strong> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the
            University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program known as
            the "National Youth Administration"
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1935</strong> - Has to stop school and save up more money.
            Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving
            Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this left
            scars on me."
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1937</strong> - Finishes university and takes a job in the
            US Forestry Service
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1938</strong> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson.
            Gets laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman,
            he returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him about
            breeding pest-resistent plants.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after the
            Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military asked
            his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria,
            disinfectants, and other applied science.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1942</strong> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant
            Pathology
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont,
            leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new
            plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds
            6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat - including
            different varieties for each major climate on Earth.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each
            season, doubling wheat yields
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1953</strong> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat
            with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that responds
            well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding
            strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate
            mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population
          </li>
          <li><strong>1970</strong> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1983</strong> - helps seven African countries dramatically
            increase their maize and sorghum yields
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1984</strong> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas
            A&M University
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the world
            food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the
            only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says
            that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been
            genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long
            before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."
          </li>
          <li><strong>2009</strong> - dies at the age of 95.</li>

> **Step 7** <br>
You should see an `a` element with a corresponding `id="tribute-link"`, which links to an outside site, that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of `target` and set it to `_blank` in order for your link to open in a new tab

> **Step 8** <br>
Your `#image` should use `max-width` and `height` properties to resize responsively, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size

```css
#styles.css
img {
  max-width: 100%;
  display: block;
  height: auto;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

#img-div {
  background: white;
  padding: 10px;
  margin: 0;

  margin: 15px 0 5px 0;
}

@media (max-width: 460px) {
  #img-caption {
    font-size: 1.4rem;
  }
}
```
> **Step 9** <br>
Your `img` element should be centered within its parent element

```css
#styles.css
#main {
  margin: 30px 8px;
  padding: 15px;
  border-radius: 5px;
  background: #eee;
}

@media (max-width: 460px) {
